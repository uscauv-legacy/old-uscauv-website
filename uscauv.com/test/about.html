      <h3>About Us</h3>
      
      <img src="images/home/3.jpg" width="300" class="right" alt="" />
      <p>USC Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team (USC AUV) represents the Viterbi School of Engineering to the international engineering community through innovation, leadership, and excellence in the field of unmanned systems. The student-led team focuses on the design and creation of an autonomous underwater vehicle for the annual international RoboSub competition, a challenging and competitive event that is co-hosted by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International.  </p>
      <p>The team has achieved impressive results while competing with the best University Engineering programs in the world. By participating and excelling in this prestigious competition, USC AUV has demonstrated to the unmanned systems community that USC Viterbi is a leading school in education and research surrounding autonomous vehicles. USC AUV is eager to continue to strive toward even greater achievement and showcase an improved autonomous vehicle at the 2013 RoboSub Competition. </p>
      <p>The team has evaluated its past performance at competition and identified areas of success and areas that need improvement. This year all designs will go through a set design cycle with two design reviews throughout the year to increase the functionality of our AUV, address previous issues, and optimize our use of valuable funding. In the past few years, the team has remodeled itself around a successful and professional design cycle that not only trains its members to achieve engineering excellence, but also improves the business model of the team. This means that funding and resources are optimally used and team members are trained to increasingly high capability.</p>
	  <p>Although the team has done well in the past, this year USC AUV is perfectly positioned to move significantly up the ranks in competition. But to do this, we need the funding that will allow us to implement the innovative designs that our team members work on all year. We are deeply grateful to the Viterbi School for supporting our team and hope that the school will consider funding our team for the 2012-2013 academic year.</p>
	  <p>The members of USC AUV are proud to represent the USC Viterbi School of Engineering at the RoboSub Competition and are dedicated to making the 2012-2013 academic year our most successful one yet. We hope that the school will consider USC AUVâ€™s funding needs as we strive to constantly improve and innovate in the field of unmanned vehicle systems.</p>

     <h4>Greater LA Botball Tournament</h4>
          <p>The annual regional tournament allows the students to showcase their hard work and compete with other teams from all over the Greater LA region.  Participants' robots are programmed to maneuver on a custom playing field in order to gain points for achieving certain tasks. <br /><br />USC AUV also participated in this tournament to display their talent. <br /><a style="float:right; margin-right:20px;" href="http://www.botball.org/events/2013-greater-los-angeles-tournament" target="_blank">Learn more</a> </p>
