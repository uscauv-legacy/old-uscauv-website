      <hr>

      <p> The SeaBee AUV is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) developed by a team of students at the University of Southern  California for the 16th International RoboSub Competition. The 2013 SeaBee AUV was entirely designed by the University of Southern California Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team and hosts an array of new features integrated into a robust returning system. New improvements such as an external frame with increased conﬁgurability, removable battery pods, modular power and GPIO infrastructure, a passive sonar array, and an advanced dynamic software architecture offer greater capability while also increasing the modularity of the SeaBee AUV for additional revision in the future.</p>

              <p>The Seabee electrical system provides the robot and its systems with power and provides the appropriate interface between all of the electrical devices. The main electrical system is made up of two backplanes, and three daughter cards each featuring its own Atmel 1280 microprocessor. This eliminates the need for excessive wires inside the submersible hull, giving the ﬁnal product a cleaner look, and increasing the overall reliability by alleviating the risk of loose wires and poor connections.</p>

              Neat. When you encounter nonsense, you struggle to make sense of it. Pedantic? Sometimes. The last time you looked at the clock it was four in the morning and you were just getting started. Flow. You know you're winning when your total being is a stream of consciousness that can only be expressed through your fingers. Your thinking is esoteric and your biggest fear is stagnation. What happens when your heart is still beating but your brain has stopped? You're determined never to find out. When you visit your family you see a directed acyclic graph, and someone asks you why you're smiling. "I'm just happy." Understading is expensive, but you think it's worth it every single time. Your future isn't programmable but you're damn well going to try. The worst case scenario is catastrophic failure. Is that worse than not trying at all? Right now you don't think so, and dear God you hope you're right.

              Most people see function, you see art. You like spaces. You like enclosing them and moving them around. Elegance and cleverness make you thrill in a way that you can't fully understand. You don't solve problems, you wait for the solutions to appear in your head. You trust your brain to take care of it, but fundamentally it's a black box. Experience, intuition, magic. Will it run out? As long as a force through a distance can actually get some work done, it won't. Not for you. Your mind depends on it, and you're built too well to break. An error of 2mm over 20 feet makes your parasympathetic nervous system go into overdrive and that's why you're here. Thinking isn't enough.
