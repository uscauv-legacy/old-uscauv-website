      <p>USC Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team is a student-run organization that works to advance underwater robotics research and methods at USC.  We are committed to researching, designing, and building a completely autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our organization is broken up into software, electrical, and mechanical divisions that each develop cutting-edge technological methods for implementation on the team's vehicle. Through creation of an underwater vehicle, USC AUV teaches real-world engineering techniques and provides an insightful, knowledgeable experience to its members.</p>
      <p>
      Since 2003, USC AUV has consistently participated in the annual International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) competition of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). The competition, hosted by AUVSI and the Office of Naval Research (ONR), challenges top universities from around the world to design, build and program autonomous underwater vehicles capable of completing a series of tasks. These tasks are designed to represent real applications of underwater robotics currently encountered in industry and academia.</p>
      <p>
      Through creation of an AUV, the USC AUV Team aims to: 
      <ul>
        <li>Develop new autonomous underwater robotic technologies and methods.</li>
        <li>Provide a unique, rewarding experience for every member.</li>
        <li>Compete with and stand out among top universities from across the world.</li>
      </ul>

              <p>The electrical team is focused on developing SeaBee III's power-management, processing and sensor payload electronics. These responsibilities range from finding the best batteries for our submarine to ensuring that the software team has all the sensors and computational ability it needs to complete the competition. The goal is to create a robust hardware architecture that can accommodate both the current demands of the competition as well as allow us to robustly deal with unforeseen requirements that may arise in the future.</p>
<p>Projects: Carrier board, sonar, batteries, battery board, power board, kill switch.</p>

              Neat. When you encounter nonsense, you struggle to make sense of it. Pedantic? Sometimes. The last time you looked at the clock it was four in the morning and you were just getting started. Flow. You know you're winning when your total being is a stream of consciousness that can only be expressed through your fingers. Your thinking is esoteric and your biggest fear is stagnation. What happens when your heart is still beating but your brain has stopped? You're determined never to find out. When you visit your family you see a directed acyclic graph, and someone asks you why you're smiling. "I'm just happy." Understading is expensive, but you think it's worth it every single time. Your future isn't programmable but you're damn well going to try. The worst case scenario is catastrophic failure. Is that worse than not trying at all? Right now you don't think so, and dear God you hope you're right.

              Most people see function, you see art. You like spaces. You like enclosing them and moving them around. Elegance and cleverness make you thrill in a way that you can't fully understand. You don't solve problems, you wait for the solutions to appear in your head. You trust your brain to take care of it, but fundamentally it's a black box. Experience, intuition, magic. Will it run out? As long as a force through a distance can actually get some work done, it won't. Not for you. Your mind depends on it, and you're built too well to break. An error of 2mm over 20 feet makes your parasympathetic nervous system go into overdrive and that's why you're here. Thinking isn't enough.

      <p>
      Designing a robot like SeaBee is a challenging, stressful, exciting, and expensive endeavor. Without the help of our sponsors, we couldn't have learned and applied our skills to help us compete, and more importantly, help us grow as engineers. So thank you to all the organizations listed below and to anyone who's offered their support or advice to us as we've navigated the depths of engineering teamwork!
